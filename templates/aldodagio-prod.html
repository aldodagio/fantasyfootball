        <h1>Aldo Dagio-Ortega</h1>

        <p>
            I am a Software Engineer with over three years of experience in the industry,
            serving as an intern from 2022-2024 and in the public sector since 2024.
            In my current role as an Information Systems Analyst II for San Joaquin County,
            as a programmer, I design many front-end solutions using a combination
            of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In unison with my front-end development, I also
            implement server-side programming using ColdFusion and ASP.NET frameworks to
            create functional and maintainable code. In this role I have been entrusted
            with important tasks that directly serve the interests of an entire county.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work, I am new father of a baby girl who was born December 2025.
            My hobbies include working on my machine learning skills, including my fantasy
            football project and kaggle competitions. I love spending time with my lovely
            girlfriend and daughter, watching movies and lounging around. I also love
            spending time with friends and my three brothers, usually watching sporting
            events like basketball, football, baseball, or boxing. I also love to workout
            by lifting weights, running, or playing sports. Finally, I can't forget about
            my dog Apollo, who is a three-year old Great Dane.
